# webdevjeffus.github.io

This is an obsolete version of my personal portfolio site. It was written in vanilla HTML5 and CSS3, with no site generator or CMS. It has not been updated or maintained since 2016, except to add this notification.

My current site is deployed at [webdevjeff.us] (http://webdevjeff.us). The new site is created and maintained using the [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/), making it much easier for me to add new content. You can view [the original Jekyll code for my new site](https://github.com/webdevjeffus/webdev-new) in its project repo.
